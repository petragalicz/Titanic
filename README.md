# Titanic
The Kaggle Challenge 

My take on Kaggle's Titanic challenge, using machine learning to create models that predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I used logistic regression and random forest in my solution and Tableau for the visualisation. 

I encountered a GitHubâ€™s rendering issue while trying to display my Jupyter notebook, however I found there is no issue with an unformatted notebook. So please see my file called titanic_without_formatting.ipynb for proper display.
